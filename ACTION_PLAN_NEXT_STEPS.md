## ⏳ **WHAT IS NOT YET BUILT**

### **MVP 2-5** ⏳ NOT BUILT

These are **PLANNED** but **NOT IMPLEMENTED**:

1. ⏳ **MVP 2: Casual Zen Edition**
   - Light, calming colors
   - Relaxation focus
   - Same chess game, different theme

2. ⏳ **MVP 3: Educational Kids Edition**
   - Bright, colorful design
   - Educational content
   - Same chess game, kid-friendly

3. ⏳ **MVP 4: Minimalist Pro Edition**

   - Ultra-minimal design
   - Same chess game, premium feel

4. ⏳ **MVP 5: Social Streamer Edition**

**To build these, we need to**:

6. Deploy separately

**This is FUTURE WORK, not current status!**
