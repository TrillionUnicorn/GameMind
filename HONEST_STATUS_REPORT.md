- Conflicts with running server
- Need to fix config

**Impact**:
- Can't run automated tests
- Manual testing still works
- Not a blocker for deployment

**Fix Needed**:
- Update playwright.config.ts
- 30 minutes to fix

### **Issue 2: MVP 2-5 Don't Exist** ⚠️
**What I Found**:
- Only documentation exists
- No actual code
- No branches created

**Why It Happens**:
- They were planned, not built
- Requires separate development

**Impact**:
- Can only deploy MVP 1
- Can't A/B test variants
- Can't target multiple audiences

**Fix Needed**:

## 💡 **MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION**

### **Option 1: Launch MVP 1 NOW** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why**:

- ✅ Gather real feedback
- ✅ Validate market fit

**Timeline**:

- This week: Launch marketing
- Next week: First users
- Month 1: Iterate based on feedback

**Then**:
- Build MVP 2-5 based on user feedback

### **Option 2: Build MVP 2-5 First**
**Why NOT**:
- ❌ Takes 4-5 weeks
- ❌ Delays revenue
- ❌ No user feedback
- ❌ Might build wrong things

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Build MVP 2
- Week 2: Build MVP 3
- Week 3: Build MVP 4
- Week 4: Build MVP 5
- Week 5: Deploy all
- Week 6: Start getting users

**Risk**:
- Users might not want variants
- Wasted development time
- Opportunity cost
